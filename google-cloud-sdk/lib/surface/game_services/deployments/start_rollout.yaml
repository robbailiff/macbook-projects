    brief:  Start Deployment rollout by providing a new game server template.
    description: |
      Start Deployment rollout by providing a new game server template. The game server template
      should include the game server spec that will be sent to Agones during rollout.

      A Deployment rollout updates game servers with a new image. The new image should be uploaded
      before its rollout can start. This can be done either by creating a new Deployment resource
      with a game server template that has the new image, or by specifying a new game server
      template with the new image for an existing Deployment resource through the start-rollout verb
      (`gcloud game-services deployments start-rollout`). The new image is specified through the
      spec field of game server template. It is a string field and follows the format of the spec
      field in Agones GameServer custom resource. Please see https://agones.dev for more details.
      Once the new game server template is specified, you can start the rollout by changing the
      percentage of game servers that run the new image through the set-rollout-target verb
      (`gcloud game-services deployments set-rollout-target`). The set-rollout-target verb specifies
      labels for clusters that should get the new image. It also specifies what percentage of game
      servers in each of the specified clusters should run the new image. Finally, you can finish
      the rollout using the commit verb (`gcloud game-services deployments commit`). This will set
      the rollout percentage to 100 in all clusters whose labels were previously specified by
      calling the set-rollout-target verb. If you need to revert a rollout, you can use the
      revert-rollout verb (`gcloud game-services deployments revert-rollout`)which deletes game
      servers running the new image.
